ssrf occur when server failed to validate parameter and this allow an attacker to gain access in internal resources
SSRF leads to access the internal pages, perform network scan 



Remember:
*.hackingwithpentesterlab.link is localhost address
we can use this payload when server is checking any particular website




There are two ways to prevent from ssrf;

1. Block list based 
2. White list based 

There are lots of ways to bypas bypass there to protection based to fix of vulnerability


finding parameter:

1. waybackurls 
2. webarchiv
3. arjun
4 and there are more

Exploitation:

find the parameter and understand the request and response:

payload

1. 127.0.0.1 or http://127.0.0.1
2. localhost or http://localhost

If both blocked then try equalent of 127.0.0.1 :

127.1 or http://127.1
localtest.me or http://localtest.me
0.0.0.0 or http://0.0.0.0
